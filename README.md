# Anki APP deck merger 


If you are using AnkiAPP ( which is a spinoff version of Anki ), like me you may have been frustrated since you can't (for some reason)
merge decks. Which can be quite annoying.

This is a simple python script that will merge all decks located in a specified directory into a new one.

V0.1 : Now has a minimalist UI for easier use

PS : If you have used multiple language version of the app, the structure of the decks will change as some XML classes will now have been translated 
(which again, doesn't make sense )

This script can bypass it only for english based version and french based versions.
