# Anki APP deck merger 


If you are using AnkiAPP ( which is a spinoff version of Anki ), like me you may have been frustrated since you can't (for some reason)
merge decks. Which can be quite annoying.

This is a simple python script that will merge all decks located in a specified directory into a new one.

Simply edit the directory path and just run it.
Might add some UI if not lazy.


PS : If you have used multiple language version of the app, the structure of the decks will change as some XML classes will now have been translated 
(which again, doesn't make sense )

This script can merge french and english versions together.
